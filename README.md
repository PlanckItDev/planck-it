# planck-it
Full Application Life Cycle

Planck-It aims to increase performance for Application Development

- Less manual actions
- Less Ressources

## How ?

This will be always work in progress!

## Benchmark

This will be always needs to be measured!

## Current Proposal

Some simple steps:

1. Plan your Application (Manual Actions ?)
2. Create your Application (Manual Actions ?)
3. Configure your Application (Manual Actions ?)
4. Verify your Application (Manual Actions ?)
5. Secure your Application (Manual Actions ?)
6. Deploy your Application (Manual Actions ?)
7. Release your Application (Manual Actions ?)
6. Monitor your Application (Manual Actions ?)

## Planck-It Platform

This will be always needs to be constructed!

## Principles

Every Action will cause a Reaction!

Aim is to process Actions when they occure and trigger Reactions when the occure!
